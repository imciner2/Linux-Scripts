This respository contains various linux scripts and installation notes compiled while working with a Fedora 18 machine.

The installation notes are formatted as a cript so that the commands listed can be more easily run, however there are still some things which must be done by the user.

To use the sublime settings, place or link the file into the user settings.
On linux, those are located in ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User
