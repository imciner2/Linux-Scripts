# To get Amazon Prime Instant Video to work on Fedora, you must do the following:
# This is based off of: http://infotech-galo.blogspot.com/2014/05/playing-amazon-prime-instant-video-on.html
# 1) Install Flash player and verify it works in Firefox

# 2) Install a wrapper for the HAL system. This is required to get the DRM system to work. To do that, use a command similat to this:
yum install http://sourceforge.net/projects/postinstaller/files/fedora/releases/20/x86_64/updates/hal-flash-0.2.0rc1-1.fc20.x86_64.rpm  
# The release number and architecture may need to be changed, just browse the files here to find the right link to the hal-flash package
# http://sourceforge.net/projects/postinstaller/files/fedora/releases/

# 3) Use Firefox to play the videos
