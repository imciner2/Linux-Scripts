# This is to install KiCad on a recent Fedora version (tested on Fedora 23)
# Note, this has not been tested with the Python scripting features of KiCad
# There is a serious bug with wxWidgets + GTK3 on many distros currently that prevents the graphics from displaying properly
# This is discussed in KiCad bug report (1339539, https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1339539)
# and KiCad question (272554, https://answers.launchpad.net/kicad/+question/272554)

# First remove any currently installed KiCad versions (This should be able to be skipped if needed)
sudo dnf remove kicad

# Then install the compatibility libraries provided in the repositories
# These libraries present a wxWidgets library that is still compiled using GTK2, and are therefore don't have this bug
sudo dnf install compat-wxGTK3-gtk2 compat-wxBase3-gtk2 compat-wxGTK3-gtk2-gl compat-wxGTK3-gtk2-devel compat-wxGTK3-gtk2-media

# Install some miscellaneous libraries required for KiCad
sudo dnf install glm-devel libcurl libcurl-devel

# Since it is not compiling Boost, make sure that the proper packages are installed (see below for reason)
# (Boost package list from here: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=798966)
sudo dnf install boost boost-devel boost-thread boost-context boost-date-time boost-filesystem boost-iostreams boost-locale boost-program-options boost-regex boost-system boost-thread

# Add the location for the new compatibility library to the path
export PATH=/usr/libexec/compat-wxGTK3-gtk2:$PATH

# This assumes that the sources are already cloned from the repository located here:
# git clone -b master https://git.launchpad.net/kicad

# Navigate to the directory for the sources and pull them
cd ~/Documents/KiCad/kicad
git pull
mkdir -p build/release
mkdir build/debug
cd build/debug

# Build and install KiCad
cmake -DKICAD_SKIP_BOOST=ON -DKICAD_SCRIPTING=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../../
make
sudo make install

# Update shared library listing if it doesn't exist (programs crash if this isn't done)
