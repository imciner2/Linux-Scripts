# When building the firmware you need to fix an issue where it does not like to build outside of a repository, follow the steps here:
#https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/commit/74ea79ff35c399e811caf11505c3f8cd8e18958c?diff=unified
# Alternately run the following commands
# ed - print_revision.sh < print_revision.ed
# ed - versionTemplate.py < versionTemplate.ed

# If print_revision.sh errors out when building, run chmod +x print_revision.sh
